# Break-the-Ball
You are given 2 crystal balls. There is a 100 story building. What is the minimum number of trials you need to make in order to find the nth floor at which the crystal ball breaks?  Note: if the ball doesnâ€™t break, you can reuse it. Implement an algorithm to find out how many trials are needed for each n.
