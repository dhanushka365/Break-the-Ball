*Assume that try at ground floor at first is useless.because if it breaks we wil left one ball.therefore programme starts with 1 st floor.
*Here my jump size is 10.as example my first out put is -The trails for 1 floor is = 2

here this comes at fisrt try the programme will jump 10 floors. if it breaks it means the ball will break in bellow floor.
then we can put our second ball from ground floor and first floor .so we can try twice.

like wise the programme will jumpu 10 floors at each time.

*At 100 floor my answer is-The trails for 100 floor is = 19
 
 starting from first floor it will go to 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90 at last it will go to 100 floor.if the ball breaks at 100 floor that meeans we should 
do the same activity again at 91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99 like wise.so to no of tries will be 10+9;
